# Animated Sprite with game pause State
Game? Nah. Example? Probably.

Made with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) & [Amethyst](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst) as an learning experience.

Change between GAMEPLAY and PAUSE state with the **Space** key.

Toggle player movement input options with the **i** key:
 - Mouse (default) -> _Move with mouse click_
 - Keyboard -> _Move with WASD_
 - Controller [not implemented yet]
